# Consumer Trends and Behavior Analytics
This project dives into consumer behavior to uncover purchasing trends across different demographics, seasons, and regions. By using SQL for data extraction and Tableau for visualization, the project reveals valuable insights that can help businesses fine-tune their marketing strategies, boost customer engagement, and optimize sales.

# Key Insights
### 1. Customer Demographics Play a Major Role

Age and gender significantly impact how customers spend. Males contribute a large share of total sales, especially within specific age groups. Interestingly, females tend to use discounts more often, but they are less likely to engage with subscription services. This presents an opportunity to develop targeted subscription packages for females, which could bridge the gap in engagement.


### 2. Seasonal Shopping Patterns

Understanding when people shop is crucial for marketers. The project identifies strong seasonal shopping trends:
Spring and Summer are the busiest shopping seasons, especially in warmer states like California and Texas, where customers tend to spend more.
Fall and Winter show more unpredictable shopping behavior. However, colder states like New York experience higher sales during these months, with Fall and Winter generating more engagement.
For marketers, this means focusing on major sales campaigns during Spring for warmer regions, while planning Fall and Winter promotions in colder states to maximize seasonal demand and drive sales.


# Conclusion
By combining Tableauâ€™s powerful visualization capabilities with SQL for data extraction, this project uncovers crucial trends in seasonal purchasing behavior, customer preferences, and demographic engagement. These insights provide businesses with a clear roadmap for improving customer acquisition, retention, and overall business growth.
